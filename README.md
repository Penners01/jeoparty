# Jeoparty!
Display the board on your laptop and use your mobile device as your controller to select clues, buzz in, and answer questions. Play alone, or with up to 98 friends!

# How to Play

1. Go to [jeoparty.io](http://jeoparty.io) on your laptop and plug it in to a TV screen or monitor. If the page is blank, just refresh your window and it should show up. Make sure to click anywhere on the main screen to unmute the game. I would personally reccomend using Google Chrome on your laptop to serve as the main screen's browser. Jeoparty! works in all major browsers but the text to speech and animation elements run more smoothly on Chrome.

2. Go to the same URL as before on your mobile device(s). There will be a form prompting your for the "Session ID" which will be displayed on the main screen.

3. Choose a nickname and signature. These will represent you on your podium in the game. Press down hard on your screen to sign your signature; the lines will appear cleaner.

4. Once the first player to join presses the 'Start Game' button, the game will begin, but any number of extra players can join anytime afterward.

5. Select clues on your phone by choosing a category, a price, then hitting the 'Submit Clue' button.

6. The answer evaluator favors a 'less is more' approach. If you're worried about something being plural, just use the singular form. It's also preferable to answer with last names instead of full names when applicable.

7. The rest of the game proceeds like the Jeopardy! TV series.
