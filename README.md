# Jeoparty!
A local multiplayer Jeopardy! game. Run the board screen on your laptop and use your mobile device as your controller to select clues, buzz in, and answer questions. Play alone, or with a limitless number of friends!

# How to Play
I'm planning to publish this game to its own website online, but in the meantime, this is the only way to play :(

## 1. Download the repository
Download this repository onto your computer by clicking the green
"Clone or Download" button in the upper right hand corner of this repository's front page.
Make sure to unzip it before going on.

## 2. Navigate to the game folder
Use the terminal to navigate to the folder where you saved the repository. For example,

In terminal:
```
cd Documents/GitHub/jeoparty
```

## 3. Download Node dependencies
This game requires a few packages from Node.js in order to function so now we
need to install all of the things that the game needs in the game folder.

In terminal:
```
npm install
```

## 3. Run the node server
Now we need to turn on a server so that the website can run locally.

In terminal:
```
node server
```

## 4. Go to the game URL
If the node server was enabled correctly, it should print out the URL of the
game website. Go to this URL on your computer's browser. I strongly recommend using Google
Chrome when playing, the graphics and text to speech functions run much more
smoothly.

## 5. Enjoy!
Go to the same URL as you did on your computer with your mobile device and join the game. Plug your laptop into a TV or monitor for maximum enjoyment.
