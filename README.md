# Jeoparty!
A local multiplayer Jeopardy! game. Run the board screen on your laptop and use your mobile device as your controller to select clues, buzz in, and answer questions. Play alone, or with a limitless number of friends!

# How to Play

## 1.
Choose a nickname and signature. These will represent you on your podium in the game. Press down hard on your screen to sign your signature, the lines will appear cleaner.

## 2.
Once the first player presses the 'Start Game' button, the game will begin, but any number of extra players can join anytime afterward.

## 3.
Plug your laptop into a TV for maximum enjoyment.

## 4.
Select clues on your phone by choosing a category, a price, then hitting the 'Submit Clue' button.

## 5.
The answer evaluator favors a 'less is more' approach. If you're worried about something being plural, just use the singular form. It's also preferable to answer with last names instead of full names when applicable.

## 6.
The rest of the game proceeds like the Jeopardy! TV series.
